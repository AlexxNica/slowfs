SlowFS is a FUSE filesystem written in Go to simulate physical media for testing
purposes. SlowFS works by mirroring a backing directory to another directory,
and then making accesses to files in that directory take a specified amount
of time. SlowFS can model things like seek time, throughput, sequential / non-
sequential accesses, et. cetera.

For more details see deviceconfig.go.

Example invocation:
  slowfs --backing-dir=my-backing-dir --mount-dir=my-mount-dir
